# SENG-300-Group-18-Project

Lteration 1 (As of March 2)

The user must have java installed in their system to run the program that we upload on this project.
The user may run the program by simply running the executable jar file or by importing the project into an IDE and running it using the IDE, or compiling and running the program with the commandline/terminal.

-The user can login using the default username "xian kong zhe " with the default Password "ye xian kong zhe".

- if the user does not use proper username and login combination, they will be prompted with a message.

- Once logged in the user can open a submission pages, they could do some operation in the pages via buttons

- The user can open one of each window simultaneously(up to 5 windows at once, main menu, journel submission window...etc.) but the user may not open more than one submission pages. The system prevents them from doing so by greying out the orresponding button that is used to open a window.

- Inside the submission pages, main menu windows the user can interact with a touchdown containing a list of dummy objects that are placeholders of the submission pages, main menu. Which will be added later on.

-At the bottom of these windows there is a search selection which currently does not do anything and will be implemented later on.

We will enchance the system to meet the needs later on.
